      'Atmosphere, A smart partner to help you learn how to make electronic music. Atmosphere gives users the experience of creating melodies and bass lines that are randomly generated by a set of parameters, and the freedom to turn dials and knobs that change the sound. This gives users a unique experience in that many of the roadblocks to understanding basic concepts of electronic music are already taken care of.',
      'The goal of this application is to give users a unique experience both visually and musically. The UI provides real-time feedback on what is happening with the changes the user is making by using an oscilloscope which is a visual representation of sound waves. My own love for electronic music came from experimentation, and Atmosphere gives the user plenty of space to twist sound into unpredictable and exciting experiences.',
