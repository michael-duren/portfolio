        The rubber <span class="font-semibold">duck</span> is a reference to the
        rubber duck debugging method. The idea is that if you are stuck on a
        problem, you should explain it to a rubber duck.

      <p class="md:text-base text-sm">
        I ❤️ this idea, because it is a reminder to take a step back, and
        really look at what you're creating. The new ideas that arise after
        talking through the code can lead us to a solution. Or not, then we try
        something else. Don't take yourself too seriously 🤷‍♂️.

        I'm a software engineer with 3+ years building production systems in C#/.NET and TypeScript. 
        After years of feature development, I'm transitioning toward infrastructure and distributed systems work—
        the layer that makes applications reliable, observable, and scalable.

      <p class="md:text-base text-sm">
        I've built <a href="/work" class="text-purple-700 hover:underline">Next Step CMS</a>, 
        a SaaS platform serving 1,200+ users managing chemical dependency treatment. 
        I maintain a home monitoring stack with Grafana, Prometheus, and node exporters across multiple VMs. 
        I contribute to open source projects like prometheus/node_exporter, learning systems programming 
        and infrastructure tooling in Go.
      </p>
      <p class="md:text-base text-sm">
        I'm drawn to the problems that live between services: how systems communicate, fail, recover, 
        and scale. I want to work on the platforms and infrastructure that make great applications possible.
