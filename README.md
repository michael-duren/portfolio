## ðŸ‘‹ About

A fun portfolio site aimed at providing an interesting experience for users interested in my work

I had a lot of fun creating this site. As a challenge I wanted to see what I could achieve without using any UI frameworks, and keeping as much of the content powered by HTML and CSS

Built with Typescript, Tailwind CSS, and Astro ðŸš€
